# Default service endpoints
#
# Endpoints are closely related to the JSONSpec DINA objects defined in
# DINA schemas.
#
# Entries declared in the relationships section correspond to navigation
# links that may be exercised when augmenting the parent object.
#
# For example in the material-sample example, without an entry for collectingEvent
# or preparationType these objects will not be automatically included and augmented
# during the creation of the augmented parent object (material-sample).
#
# Entries defined under the 'embedded' section correspond to parent document type.
# For example the entry 'person' under the organization embedded section denotes that
# 'organization' is embedded under a 'person' document when pushed into elasticsearch.
