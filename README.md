# search-ws
The search-ws application provides a thin layer of abstraction on top of a DINA managed elasticsearch cluster. The first endpoint offers access to auto complete searches (search_as_you_type) and while the second reads elasticsearch JSON based queries that are forwarded to the cluster API.
