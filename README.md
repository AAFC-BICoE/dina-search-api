# Search API

The Search API brings documents search capabilities through the following projects:

- [search-cli](search-cli/README.md) A command line interface providing documents retrieval and indexing with a DINA managed Elasticsearch cluster. 
- [search-ws](search-ws/README.md) A REST based application providing search capabilities through a thin layer of abstraction built on top of the DINA managed Elasticsearch cluster.
