# Default service endpoints
#
# Endpoints are closely related to the JSONSpec DINA objects defined in
# DINA schemas.
#
# Entries declared in the relationships section correspond to objects to
# be included during the retrieval of their parent object.
#
# For example in the material-sample example, without an entry for collectingEvent
# or preparationType these objects will not be automatically included. 
# Augmentation of objects is done using the same endpoint when external object references
# are found during processing of an object.
